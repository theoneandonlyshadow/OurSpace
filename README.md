 This is the first ever Chatting website integration with a Discord bot.

1. Basically all i did was to create a frontend and a backend server to hold the website all together.

2. First half of the server.js contains the backend server and the other half of it contains the Discord.js code.

Im currently expanding this project with MongoDB and Passport.js.
